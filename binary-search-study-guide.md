# Binary Search - Study Guide

## Introduction to Binary Search
Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half, reducing the search space with each step. It works only on sorted arrays.

### Algorithm Steps:
1. Start with two pointers, `low` (start of array) and `high` (end of array).
2. Find the middle index, `mid = low + (high - low) / 2`.
3. Compare the middle element with the target:
   - If the element is equal to the target, return the index.
   - If the element is smaller, move the `low` pointer to `mid + 1`.
   - If the element is larger, move the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`.
4. Repeat until `low > high` or target is found.

Time Complexity: O(log n)  
Space Complexity: O(1) for iterative, O(log n) for recursive.

## Applications of Binary Search:
1. Efficiently search in sorted arrays.
2. Finding lower/upper bounds.
3. Solving optimization problems using Binary Search on the answer.
4. Finding peaks, square roots, and more.

## Variants of Binary Search
1. Standard Binary Search - Searches for a target element.
2. Lower Bound (First Occurrence) - Finds the first position of a target.
3. Upper Bound (Last Occurrence) - Finds the last position of a target.
4. Finding Peak Element - Finds a peak element in a bitonic array.
5. Search in a Rotated Sorted Array
6. Binary Search on Answer - Solving optimization problems.
