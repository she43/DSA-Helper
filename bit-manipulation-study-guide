### Mastering Bit Manipulation: A Guide to Essential Techniques and Practice Problems

Bit manipulation is a powerful technique for solving various problems efficiently by working directly with the binary representation of numbers. In competitive programming and coding interviews, mastering bit manipulation can save time and simplify complex logic. Below is a comprehensive guide to learning and practicing bit manipulation, complete with popular LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks questions to solidify your understanding.

### 1. **Understanding the Basics of Bit Manipulation**

Bit manipulation relies on performing operations directly on the binary bits of numbers. The most common bitwise operators are:

- **AND (`&`)**: Used to check if specific bits are set, or to clear bits.
- **OR (`|`)**: Used to set specific bits in a number.
- **XOR (`^`)**: Toggles bits or compares two numbers bit by bit.
- **NOT (`~`)**: Inverts all the bits of a number.
- **Left Shift (`<<`)**: Multiplies the number by powers of two.
- **Right Shift (`>>`)**: Divides the number by powers of two, used to extract specific bits.

Understanding these operators is essential before diving into advanced techniques.

2. [LeetCode #231 - Power of Two](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-two/)
3. [LeetCode #371 - Sum of Two Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers/)
4. [GeeksforGeeks - Count set bits](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-set-bits-in-an-integer/)
5. [LeetCode #136 - Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)

### 2. **Power of Two Checks**

One of the common applications of bit manipulation is checking whether a number is a power of two. A number is a power of two if it has exactly one bit set in its binary representation. You can check this with the following expression:  
```c
x & (x - 1) == 0
```
If the result is `0`, the number is a power of two.

**Key Insight**: Numbers like 1, 2, 4, 8, etc., have only one bit set, which makes this check very efficient.

**Recommended Practice Problems**:
1. [LeetCode #231 - Power of Two](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-two/)
2. [GeeksforGeeks - Check if a number is a power of two](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-to-find-whether-a-no-is-power-of-two/)
3. [LeetCode #342 - Power of Four](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-four/)
4. [LeetCode #326 - Power of Three](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-three/)
5. [LeetCode #137 - Single Number II](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/)

### 3. **Counting Set Bits (Hamming Weight)**

The **Hamming weight** of a number refers to the number of `1` bits in its binary representation. To efficiently count set bits, the following approach can be used:
```c
x &= (x - 1)
```
This expression clears the lowest set bit, allowing you to count the bits without iterating over every bit position.

**Key Insight**: Each iteration of the loop clears one set bit, which makes this technique particularly efficient for counting `1` bits.

**Recommended Practice Problems**:
1. [LeetCode #191 - Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)
2. [GeeksforGeeks - Brian Kernighan's Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-set-bits-in-an-integer/)
3. [LeetCode #338 - Counting Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/)
4. [GeeksforGeeks - Flip all bits of a number](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/flip-bits-number/)
5. [LeetCode #476 - Number Complement](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/)

### 4. **Swapping Two Numbers Using XOR**

A popular trick in bit manipulation is swapping two numbers without using a temporary variable. By applying XOR operations, you can swap the values of two variables as follows:
```c
x = x ^ y;
y = x ^ y;
x = x ^ y;
```

**Key Insight**: XORing a number with itself results in `0`, and XORing with `0` leaves the number unchanged, making this swap possible in-place.

**Recommended Practice Problems**:
1. [LeetCode #136 - Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)
2. [GeeksforGeeks - Swap two numbers without a temporary variable](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swap-two-numbers-without-using-temporary-variable/)
3. [LeetCode #137 - Single Number II](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/)
4. [LeetCode #260 - Single Number III](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/)
5. [LeetCode #268 - Missing Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/)

### 5. **Reversing Bits**

Reversing the bits of a number involves taking the binary representation of the number and flipping the order of its bits. This can be efficiently done by shifting bits and combining them using bitwise OR.

**Key Insight**: By shifting the bits one at a time and using bitwise OR to accumulate the result, you can reverse the bits of a number.

**Recommended Practice Problems**:
1. [LeetCode #190 - Reverse Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/)
